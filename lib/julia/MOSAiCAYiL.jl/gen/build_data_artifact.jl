    build_data_artifact.jl

Fetch the MOSAiC AYiL model configuration and results from Zenodo, bind it as a
lazy artifact, and print the resulting `Artifacts.toml` entry.

Run once; the entry it prints is what ships in `Artifacts.toml`, after which the
package downloads the data on first use and nobody needs to run this again.
